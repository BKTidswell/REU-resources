# Lab Software

Useful software/web resources that the lab uses

# Reference Manager

I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as a reference manager for organizing, sharing, reading, and annotating journal articles.
Zotero is free to use, but the free plan does have a limit to how many PDFs it can store or sync to your personal library.
I recommend you download the desktop version of Zotero and install the browser connector.

# Slack

We will use the lab Slack as our main every day way of communication.
Use it to ask questions, share resources, celebrate successes, or just to chat.
I almost always have Slack open while I'm working.

# R and RStudio

We will primarily use the statistical programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for data wrangling and analysis.
It's best to interact with R through [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
Both are free, and you should install both if you're going to use your personal computer.

## Getting started with R

-   [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html) from Data Carpentry is a good book for beginner to intermediate R users.
-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great book for beginner to intermediate R users that focuses on practical skills related to wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data (but not statistics) using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This book assumes you know a little bit about R, so it's probably not appropriate for those completely new to R or programming.

## Useful packages when getting started with R

-   [Tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html): a set of packages for importing, tidying, and visualizing data (and so much more).

# Git and GitHub

Git is a [version control](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) software that is probably already installed on your computer if you use a mac, and can be installed for Windows [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
GitHub is this website right here!
It's a website for collaboratively interacting with git-tracked projects.
As we got along in the summer I'll show you hwo to use git and GitHub as it will be an important way for us to share code and collaborate on projects.

# DeepLabCut

DeepLabCut is the software that we'll be using this summer in order to track fish videos. You'll need to install Python though Anaconda, and then use that to install DeepLabcut

-   [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
-   [Install DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md)
-   [Refine Tracklets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEuBKB7eqmk&t=21s)
-   [Refine Tracklets (Written Version)](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/maDLC_UserGuide.md#refine-tracklets)
