# Lab Software

Useful software/web resources that the lab uses

# Reference Manager

We use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as a reference manager for organizing, sharing, reading, and annotating journal articles.
Zotero is free to use, but the free plan does have a limit to how many PDFs it can store or sync to your personal library.
If you join the [Bruna Lab group Zotero collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2603950/heliconia-frag-drought), however, this shouldn't be an issue.
We recommend you download the desktop version of Zotero and install the browser connector.

In our [lab Zotero collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2603950/heliconia-frag-drought) you'll find a folder called REU Reading with sub-folders for general advice for doing science, and background reading for the BDFFP and on *Heliconia acuminata*.
This isn't meant to be a required reading list necessarily, so don't feel like you have to read everything right away.
<!--# this should go in the README -->

# Slack

We will use the lab Slack as our main every day way of communication.
Use it to ask questions, share resources, celebrate successes, or just to chat.
Eric almost always has Slack open when he's working, and Emilio checks in often as well.

# Zoom

Eric *might* make us a lab [gather.town](https://gather.town/) space, but for now we'll hold weekly meetings and other meetings over [Zoom](https://ufl.zoom.us/).

# R and RStudio

We primarily use the statistical programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for data wrangling and analysis.
It's best to interact with R through [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
Both are free, and you should install both if you're going to use your personal computer.

## Getting started with R

-   R4DS for intermediate data science type stuff

# Git and GitHub

Git is a [version control](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) software that is probably already installed on your computer if you use a mac, and can be installed for Windows [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
GitHub is this website right here!
It's a website for collaboratively interacting with git-tracked projects.
You will be trained in the use of git and GitHub as it will be an important way for us to share code and collaborate on projects.
