# Peer Code Review

Peer code review is a practice commonly used in the software industry ....

# Activity outline

1. Demonstration of how to fork and clone a GitHub repository
    - **Forking** makes a copy of a repository that is connected to the original, but lives on your GitHub account
    - Useful for when you don't have permission to push to a repository, but want to make changes
    - It's possibly to integrate the changes in your fork with the original through a **pull request**
    
2. One student volunteers a repo for code review and *briefly* (1-2 sentences) explains the big-picture goal of the code.

3. After forking the repository, reviewers take 10â€“15 minutes to independently work through the code to run and understand it.  Prioritize the following goals:
    1. Reproducibility: Get the code to run on your computer without producing errors.
    2. Documentation:  Note where variable names or the purpose of code is confusing.  Note where the purpose of blocks of code is clear or unclear.
    3. Readability: Suggest changes that make the code more human-readable.  These could be formatting suggestions or different approaches to solving the same problem.
    
4. Re-convene and discuss as a group. Was everyone able to get code to run?  What were the sticking points? Any areas where code worked, but unclear what it was doing?  Use line numbers when discussing, so everyone can follow along.

5. Demonstration of pull request on GitHub.  I don't necessarily recommend that all reviewers make pull requests, as merging multiple pull requests might lead to merge conflicts and other git issues.

6. Demonstrate issues on GitHub.  This might be a more appropriate venue for student reviewers to share their reviews.
