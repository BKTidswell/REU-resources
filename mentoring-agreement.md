# Expectations

## Lab Code of Conduct

Everyone in the lab is expected to read and follow the [lab code of conduct](https://github.com/BrunaLab/Code_of_Conduct).

## Self-directed Learning

We think it is important that your REU experience is built largely around self-directed learning.
We believe it is important for your professional development and learning that you create a project *you* are interested in and can take ownership in.
To that end, we expect you to be curious, ask questions, develop hypotheses, and think through explanations of any results you find.
Our main role in your project as mentors is to provide you with the knowledge, tools, skills, guidance, feedback, and teamwork necessary to accomplish your goals.

## Mentor Expectations

Eric will serve as your primary mentor and point of contact for the summer.
Eric lives in Massachusetts, and currently has no plans of visiting Gainesville this summer, so your main way of communicating with him will be through the lab Slack and via Zoom meetings.
You should expect Eric to be active in the lab Slack during his working hours (roughly 9--5, M--F) and to be available for impromptu Zoom meetings when needed.

Emilio will also be active on the lab Slack and will be available to meet when needed outside of our weekly lab meetings.
Emilio will be the first point of contact if you need in-person help with something, such as getting set up with a desk or lab computer on campus.

You should expect us to: 

- Be facilitators, not a hinderance 
- Keep regularly scheduled meetings and checkins 
- Check in \~daily (M--F) on the lab Slack channel 
- Be flexible in scheduling - Get mentees started on independent projects quickly

## Mentee Expectations

-   Keep up with reading before lab meetings, ask questions and participate
-   Come prepared to individual meetings.
-   Check in \~daily (M--F) on the lab Slack channel.
-   Let us know if you're not going to make a meeting or will be out of the office.

### Work Hours

Expect to spend about 30--40 hours per week focused on "work" related to the REU.
How you schedule those hours is totally up to you---if you work best in the evenings and want to take mornings off, that's fine---but your "work day" should overlap with others in the lab at least 20 hours a week.
It's important to remember that your "work" includes learning (reading, watching/listening to relevant talks, podcasts, lectures, tutorials), and thinking in addition to analyzing data, writing, and putting together presentations to communicate your findings.

### Lab Community

You should expect to have a weekly lab meeting as well as individual meeting(s) with your mentor(s).
Outside of these meetings, you are expected to be active in the lab Slack.
This is especially important since one of your mentors (Eric) is working remote, and Slack will be your main everyday way of interacting with him.
This doesn't mean you need to have Slack open all the time, but you should check it at least daily.

We expect that you (the two mentees) help eachother when possible.
This does not mean you are on your own---definitely ask questions of your mentors if you have them---but we believe that peer learning/teaching is an important and effective way of learning things.

### Feedback

If there's something we are doing that is holding you back or making the REU experience un-enjoyable, or there is something we could be doing to enhance your learning experience, we expect you to let us know.
We welcome suggestions and constructive criticism and we will do our best to make changes to help you get the most out of the summer.
