Resources for REU students in the Bruna Lab

# Required Software

## Zotero

We use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) as a reference manager for organizing, sharing, reading, and annotating journal articles.  Zotero is free to use, but the free plan does have a limit to how many PDFs it can store or sync to your personal library.  If you join the [Bruna Lab group Zotero collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2603950/heliconia-frag-drought), however, this shouldn't be an issue. We recommend you download the desktop version of Zotero and install the browser connector.

## Slack

We will use the lab Slack as our main every day way of communication. Use it to ask questions, share resources, celebrate successes, or just to chat.  Eric almost always has Slack open when he's working, and Emilio checks in often as well.

## Zoom

Eric *might* make us a lab [gather.town](https://gather.town/) space, but for now we'll hold weekly meetings and other meetings over [Zoom](https://ufl.zoom.us/).

## R and R Studio

We primarily use the statistical programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) for data wrangling and analysis.  It's best to interact with R through [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).  Both are free, and you should install both if you're going to use your personal computer.


# Finding and Reading Scientific Papers
- Never pay for access to a paper
- links to library, google scholar, setting up VPN, etc.

In our [lab Zotero collection](https://happygitwithr.com/) you'll find a folder called REU Reading with sub-folders for general advice for doing science, and background reading for the BDFFP and on *Heliconia acuminata*.  This isn't meant to be a required reading list necessarily, so don't feel like you have to read everything right away.

# Getting started with R
- links to good beginner R tutorial
- R4DS for intermediate data science type stuff

# Help with Git and GitHub
- You will get some kind of training in Git and GitHub, but here's resources if you're stuck or trying to do something more advanced.
