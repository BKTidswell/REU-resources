#### Week 2: The Lateral Line and R (June 6th)

There are a few topics I think are essential that we discuss but I want your input on what else you'd like to discuss.
Possible topics include (but aren't limited to):

-   Library research and bibliographic tools
-   CV / resume workshop
-   Applying to graduate school
-   Hypotheses in biology (when are they useful? how to write good ones?)

**Readings:**

-   [R Cookbook 2e](https://rc2e.com/) Chapters 1 - 3
-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) Chapter 1 to 1.3

**Additional Resources:**

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great book for beginner to intermediate R users that focuses on practical skills related to wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data (but not statistics) using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This book assumes you know a little bit about R, so it's probably not appropriate for those completely new to R or programming.
-   [R Cookbook 2e](https://rc2e.com/) is a great book that goes from beginner to advanced usage, and provides a good reference for a lot of R skills
-   [Our Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html) is a good site that goes through some of the basics in R, and has a lot of specific tutorials, that may be more niche than then other two books.

- MUST READ: Hadley Wickham's [How to write a reproducible example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html)
- The [`reprex` package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)
- R Foundation Posting Guide: [How to ask good questions that prompt useful answers](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html).
- Example: [Emilio's first question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18406652/split-a-vector-into-three-vectors-of-unequal-length-in-r) on StackOverflow. After two days of struggling I posted the question at 15:33 pm; the solution was posted only four minutes later! And it can help others too...this question is the recipient of a "Famous Question" badge for having >10,000 views.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

#### Week 10: Last Week! (August 1st)

-   The REU Symposium is this week! We'll be working on your poster and data analysis
-   Good time to start thinking about the Fall, if you want to continue research then.

### Other Things To Do:

-   Learn how to use and code Ardunios
