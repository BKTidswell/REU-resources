<!--# more here about structure of repo and purpose -->

\#TODO:

-   figure out rough dates of tehse weeks and allow time for ESA watch party (aug 2-6)

## Syllabus

In addition to weekly individual Zoom meetings with Eric, we will hold weekly lab meetings (time TBD) to discuss topics related to your projects as well as professional development and other important topics in science.
The topics are subject to change (especially later in the summer) and we will ask for your feedback and suggestions, so think of this as a draft or an example.
Additional readings are things you should look through on your own outside of lab meeting and discuss with everyone on Slack if you want.
Readings can be found in the [lab Zotero collection](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2603950/heliconia-frag-drought) as well as in your welcome binder.
