# Bruna Lab REU Summer 2021 resources

Check out the [mentoring agreement](mentoring-agreement.md) and list of recommended [software](software.md) for the lab.

## Syllabus

In addition to working on individual research projects, we will discuss topics related to ecology and STEM in general each week.

(Will change order later)
